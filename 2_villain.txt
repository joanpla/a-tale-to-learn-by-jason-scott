In a castle upon the highest mountain lives Amancio, an old and wretched villain whose only purpose in life has been to amass gold. 
We must admit that he has been quite successful in this area, as he owns 99% of the gold in the whole world. 
Nevertheless, he is not happy, his thirst for power is not satisfied, since he is still looking for a mythical unicorn, 
the most valuable of all creatures. Armed with his gold plated wallet-sword, Amancio set off to find one and he was determined to not let anyone get in his way.
